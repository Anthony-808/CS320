# CS320
I’m still new to programming, so I don’t have a definitive approach yet, but I've developed a process that emphasizes planning and testing. To ensure functionality and security, I plan carefully before writing code, test each part thoroughly, and ensure data is handled safely. My design approach has five steps: gather requirements, interpret requirements, plan architecture and tests, write pseudocode, and then write code. I see gathering requirements as the most important step. When doing so, I try to understand why a specific feature is wanted so I can interpret and incorporate it correctly. From my experience, when the requirements are solid, the rest of the implementation flows well.
